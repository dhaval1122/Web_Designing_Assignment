Que.-> What are different types of lists in HTML? With Example.

Ans.-> HTML provides several types of lists that you can use to organize and present information on web pages.

Types of list:
    1. Ordered List:
    -> Ordered lists are used for items that have a specific order or sequence.
    -> Each list item is automatically numbered by default, typically with Arabic numerals (1, 2, 3, etc.).
    -> You can customize the numbering style using CSS.
    -> Ex. <ol>
                <li>First item</li>
                <li>Second item</li>
                <li>Third item</li>
            </ol>

    2. Unordered List:
    -> Unordered lists are used for items that don't have a specific order or sequence.
    -> Each list item is typically represented with a bullet point by default.
    -> You can customize the bullet style using CSS.
    -> Ex. <ul>
                <li>Apples</li>
                <li>Bananas</li>
                <li>Oranges</li>
            </ul>

    3. Nested List:
    -> You can nest lists inside other lists to create more complex list structures.
    -> For example, you can nest an ordered or unordered list within a list item of another list.
    -> Ex. <ol>
            <li>Fruits</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Apples</li>
                <li>Bananas</li>
                <li>Oranges</li>
            </ul>
         <li>Vegetables</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Carrots</li>
                <li>Spinach</li>
                <li>Tomatoes</li>
            </ul>
            </ol>
