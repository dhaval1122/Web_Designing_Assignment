Que.-> What are HTML Entities? With Example.

Ans.-> HTML entities are special codes or character references used to represent reserved characters and symbols in HTML documents.

    -> These reserved characters and symbols include characters that have special meanings in HTML, such as angle brackets (< and >), ampersands (&), etc.
    -> HTML entities are written using the ampersand (&) followed by a specific code or name, and then closed with a semicolon (;).
    -> Here are some examples of HTML entities:
        &lt; represents the less-than sign <.
        &gt; represents the greater-than sign >.
        &amp; represents the ampersand &.
        &quot; represents the double quote "
        &nbsp; represents the non-breaking space.

    -> Example of emojis: <h1> &#128515 &#128509 &#128519 </h1>

    -> Example of non-breaking space: <h1> Dhaval&nbsp;Thakkar </h1> 
        Output: Dhaval Thakkar
