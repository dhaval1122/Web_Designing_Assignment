Que.-> What is a Bootstrap Container, and how does it work?

Ans.-> Containers are a fundamental building block of Bootstrap that contain, pad, and align your content within a given device or viewport. 

-> Containers are the most basic layout element in Bootstrap and are required when using our default grid system. Containers are used to contain, pad, and (sometimes) center the content within them. While containers can be nested, most layouts do not require a nested container.

Bootstrap comes with three different containers:

.container, which sets a max-width at each responsive breakpoint
.container-fluid, which is width: 100% at all breakpoints
.container-{breakpoint}, which is width: 100% until the specified breakpoint

<div class="container-sm">100% wide until small breakpoint</div>
<div class="container-md">100% wide until medium breakpoint</div>
<div class="container-lg">100% wide until large breakpoint</div>
<div class="container-xl">100% wide until extra large breakpoint</div>
<div class="container-xxl">100% wide until extra extra large breakpoint</div>
